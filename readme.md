# Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this assessment. 

I have been working with Laravel for many years and if was fun to work with a legacy version of 5.8.  

I used livewire to replace a datatable and used jQuery for the ID validation. I didn’t bother with the other fields as this would be standard practice. 

I also added a translation in English and it would be very simple to add more translations. 

I used CDN files in place of Laravel Mix. 

This is a basic CRUD and could look much better if I dedicated more time to it. I specialize in internal systems and user experience.
